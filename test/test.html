        <h1>Alice speaks to Cheshire Cat</h1>
        <p>The Cat only grinned when it saw Alice. It looked good-natured, she thought: still it had very long claws and a great many teeth, so she felt that it ought to be treated with respect.</p>
        <p>&quot;Cheshire Puss,&quot; she began, rather timidly, as she did not at all know whether it would like the name: however, it only grinned a little wider. &quot;Come, it's pleased so far,&quot; thought Alice, and she went on. &quot;Would you tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?&quot;</p>
        <p>&quot;That depends a good deal on where you want to get to,&quot; said the Cat.</p>
        <p>&quot;I don't much care where&mdash;&quot; said Alice.</p>
        <p>&quot;Then it doesn't matter which way you go,&quot; said the Cat.</p>
        <p>&quot;&mdash;so long as I get somewhere,&quot; Alice added as an explanation.</p>
        <p>&quot;Oh, you're sure to do that,&quot; said the Cat, &quot;if you only walk long enough.&quot;</p>
        <p>Alice felt that this could not be denied, so she tried another question. &quot;What sort of people live about here?&quot;</p>
        <p>&quot;In that direction,&quot; the Cat said, waving its right paw round, &quot;lives a Hatter: and in that direction,&quot; waving the other paw, &quot;lives a March Hare. Visit either you like: they're both mad.&quot;</p>
        <p>&quot;But I don't want to go among mad people,&quot; Alice remarked.</p>
        <p>&quot;Oh, you can't help that,&quot; said the Cat: &quot;we're all mad here. I'm mad. You're mad.&quot;</p>
        <p>&quot;How do you know I'm mad?&quot; said Alice.</p>
        <p>&quot;You must be,&quot; said the Cat, &quot;or you wouldn't have come here.&quot;</p>
